# Awesome Daylight Computer DC-1 Resources

A curated list of cool projects, apps, and resources for the [Daylight Computer DC-1](https://daylightcomputer.com/product) - the blue light-free tablet that protects your circadian rhythm with its custom Reflective LCD display called LivePaper.

> The DC-1 features a custom IGZO rLCD display produced by SHARP with two independent backlights, including a 100% blue light-free option, which is the amber backlight that you see on most pictures of it. It works beautifully outdoors and even in direct sunlight, often without requiring any backlight.

## üéØ Tidbits

### Display Settings
- During the day I barely touch the amber backlight, taking advantage of the reflective mode
- Default 60hz should be sufficient for most, if you like high refresh rates, do the following:
  - Open Settings, go to About Tablet, tap on Build Number until a tool tip says you're now a developer, then search for either `120hz` or `Smooth Display` in Settings's search bar
