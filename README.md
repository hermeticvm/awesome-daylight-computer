# Awesome Daylight Computer DC-1 Resources

A curated list of cool projects, apps, and resources for the [Daylight Computer DC-1](https://daylightcomputer.com/product) - the blue light-free tablet that protects your circadian rhythm with its custom Reflective LCD display called LivePaper.

<img src="logo.avif" alt="Daylight Computer DC-1" width="400" />

> The DC-1 features a custom IGZO rLCD display produced by SHARP with two independent backlights, including a 100% blue light-free option, which is the amber backlight that you see on most pictures of it. It works beautifully outdoors and even in direct sunlight, often without requiring any backlight.

This [Android Police interview](https://www.androidpolice.com/origins-daylight-dc-1-with-creator-anjan-katta/) with the founder Anjan Katta is a good primer on the display technology.

### Android reading apps

In case you also tend to read many books in parallel as I do. This will make it easier because you won't have to switch between books and can just switch between apps.

- **[FBReader](https://fbreader.org/android)** - Another e-book reader, not free software but their [heart's in the right place](https://fbreader.org/blog/why_we_are_building_readino) at least

## Android Keyboards

- **[Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/)** - Alternative App Store where you can sign your apps using your nostr key

## Tidbits

### Display Settings
- During the day I barely touch the amber backlight, taking advantage of the reflective mode
- Default 60hz should be sufficient for most, if you like high refresh rates, do the following:
  - Open Settings, go to About Tablet, tap on Build Number until a tool tip says you're now a developer, then search for either `120hz` or `Smooth Display` in Settings's search bar
