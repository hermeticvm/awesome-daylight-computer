# Awesome Daylight Computer DC-1 Resources

A curated list of cool projects, apps, and resources for the [Daylight Computer DC-1](https://daylightcomputer.com/product) - the blue light-free tablet that protects your circadian rhythm with its custom Reflective LCD display called LivePaper.

> The DC-1 features a custom IGZO rLCD display produced by SHARP with two independent backlights, including a 100% blue light-free option, which is the amber backlight that you see on most pictures of it. It works beautifully outdoors and even in direct sunlight, often without requiring any backlight.

This [Android Police interview](https://www.androidpolice.com/origins-daylight-dc-1-with-creator-anjan-katta/) with the founder Anjan Katta is a good primer on the display technology.

## Reader Apps

### Android reading apps

In case you also tend to read many books in parallel as I do. This will make it easier because you won't have to switch between books and can just switch between apps. 

### Free Software readers

- **[Kindle Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en_US)** - Amazon's official reader, in case you like paying for licenses to books instead of owning them
- **[FBReader](https://fbreader.org/android)** - Another e-book reader, not free software but their [heart's in the right place](https://fbreader.org/blog/why_we_are_building_readino) at least

## Android Keyboards

### Open Source Keyboards

I don't like to feed Google so I disabled Gboard. Only disable Gboard after installing and selecting at least one alternative.

- **[FUTO Keyboard](https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard)** - Privacy-respecting keyboard
- **[FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard)** - Modern, privacy-focused keyboard
- **[HeliBoard](https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard)** - Open-source keyboard based on AOSP

- **[Burrow UI](https://github.com/hamsterbase/Burrow-UI)** - Clean, distraction-free launcher, vibe-coded by someone (good work!)
- **[Olauncher](https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher)** - Clean, minimalist launcher made by [this Minimalism fella](https://x.com/tanujnotes)

## Useful Tools

- **[KeyMapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper)** - Configure the two as-of-yet unused keys on the DC-1 for custom shortcuts

## Lightweight app alternatives

### App Stores
- **[Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/)** - Open-source Google Play Store client, to install Play Store apps without a Google account

## Tidbits

### Display Settings
- During the day I barely touch the amber backlight, taking advantage of the reflective mode
- Default 60hz should be sufficient for most, if you like high refresh rates, do the following:
  - Open Settings, go to About Tablet, tap on Build Number until a tool tip says you're now a developer, then search for either `120hz` or `Smooth Display` in Settings's search bar
